# How to Build the Perfect Sandwich

When it comes to sandwiches achieving the status of perfect is not as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a little patience, dedication, and ingredients you love. The following is a brief breakdown of how to make the perfect sandwich.

## Ingredients

The ingredients are probably the most crucial aspect of sandwich creation. Having high-quality and fresh ingredients makes all the difference. The perfect sandwich must-haves are as follows:

+ High-quality bread, homemade is even better
+ A meat of choice (turkey, ham, salami, etc) + Good melty cheese (freshly sliced or grated is best, *also* room temperature makes for easier melting)
+ Tomato
+ Onion
+ Lettuce
+ Mayonnaise 
+ Mustard
+ Hot sauce of choice

## Assembly

Once you have your army of ingredients at the ready it’s time to begin to craft your masterpiece. You must ***always*** toast your bread, if you’re toasting on the stovetop apply your cheese once you have one side done to allow it to melt. If you are using a toaster just apply the cheese to the hot bread as soon as possible. After which step you may evenly and generously spread your mayo and mustard. Following that, lay some nice crispy leaves of lettuce down. Next you will layer your chosen meat in nice little bundles across the entire surface. Lastly topping with your tomato, onion, and hot sauce drizzle. Sandwich your two halves together and **ta-da**! You’re almost there, one last step!

## Presentation Method

All that is left is cutting your sandwich and plating. Not *so* bad right? Please cut your sandwich **diagonally** none of this in the middle stuff! You need the sharp corners to be able to start the *perfect* bites. Additionally you may plate with some carrot sticks or chips depending on your preference!

> Tip: Use a serrated knife when slicing through your finished sandwich for any easier and more even cut.
